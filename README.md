# Cycling-rides-tracker
Project to track cycling rides and riders taking part in them

This project uses a simple SQL database to store cyclists and cycle rides. There are utlity functions where rides
and cyclist can be created, each with their own relevant attributes. Cyclist can then be added to rides, with all data saved within the database.

This is a test-case project which I plan to build out into a full Django app with more functionality including generating statistics.
